## About the project
The Convolutional Neural Network built for this project allows to classify images of horses and humans. 
This is a learning project that makes use of the dataset of 300Ã—300 images, created by Laurence Moroney,
that is licensed CC-By-2.0 for anybody to use in learning or testing computer vision algorithms. Image augmentation was used to create more data for training the model.
The code allows to test the model on two images of horses and humans directly in Jupyter Notebook.
